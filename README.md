## Basics of Java Development. Algorithms.

### Few words about this project.
This project represents my sklls in basic algorithms. Here, i'am trying to realize  
different variants of searching and sorting primitive data, using Java Core only. This project
will be constantly evolve by me, during the process of my professional skills growing up.

### Process history:
1. Sorting:
    * [03.09.2020] Bubble sort implementation;
    * [05.09.2020] Selection sort implementation;
    * [05.09.2020] Quick sort implementation;
    * [10.09.2020] Count sort implementation;
2. Searching:
    * [05.09.2020] Search minimal value implementation;
    * [07.09.2020] Search 'linear' implementation;
    * [07.09.2020] Search 'binary' implementation;
